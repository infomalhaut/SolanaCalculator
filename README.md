# SolanaCalculator

In this repo, I have created a calculator using solana program. I used anchor framework.

This is a tutorial in https://openquest.xyz/ . Anybody can go through this tutorial : **Create a calculator using rust programs** in Solana Track for free of cost.

This was possible for me because of Questbook, Layer3 and Superteam DAO
